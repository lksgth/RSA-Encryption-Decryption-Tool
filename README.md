# RSA-Encryption-Decryption-Tool
# How to use the tool
Start index.py

Type in a number to select an action.
  1. Generate keys
  2. Encrypt text
  3. Decrypt codes list
  4. Close the program
  
# Keys
To keep it simple, the RSA keys are represented as two ints each. (number1,number2)

To use a key, copy only the numbers seperated by a comma. Do not copy any empty spaces or other chars!

# Encrypted codes list
The codes list is a list of number sepereated by a comma. To encrypt a codes list copy only the numbers seperated by a comma. Do not copy any empty spaces or other chars!

# Encryption
  1. Type in a text.
  2. Paste in a public key. (Only copy the two numbers seperated by a comma! Do not copy any empty spaces!)
  3. Copy the codes (Only copy the numbers seperated by a comma! Do not copy any empty spaces!)
 
# Decryption
  1. Paste in the codes
  2. Past in your private key. (Only copy the two numbers seperated by a comma! Do not copy any empty spaces!)
  3. Receive the decrypted text!
